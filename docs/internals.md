## Desktop snapshot

Every backend normalizes UI state into `DesktopElement`s.

```python
DesktopElement(
    id="ax_91da...",
    role="TextField",
    name="Search Effects",
    value="",
    actions=(
        ActionKind.CLICK,
        ActionKind.TYPE_TEXT,
    ),
    source="macos_ax",
)
```

A `DesktopSnapshot` contains:

- application
- active window
- semantic / visual elements
- context
- revision fingerprint

The decision policy can only select operations and IDs exposed by the current snapshot. It cannot invent arbitrary selectors or coordinates. Coordinates remain a backend implementation detail.

---

## Accessibility

macOS Accessibility provides semantic controls:

```python
DesktopElement(
    id="ax_91da...",
    role="TextField",
    name="Search",
    value="",
    actions=(
        ActionKind.CLICK,
        ActionKind.TYPE_TEXT,
    ),
    source="macos_ax",
)
```

The AX backend can currently:

- inspect one application, given by process ID, and its window on the current desktop
- traverse the accessibility tree
- read names, roles, values and state
- invoke native accessibility actions
- focus and edit text controls
- operate buttons and menus
- set supported values
- issue keyboard shortcuts and scrolling
- validate a target immediately before mutation

AX identity uses Core Foundation equality and hashing, with collision checks, rather
than wrapper memory addresses. The normal and modal traversals share those IDs.
References are retained across observations and retired when no longer observed.
Opaque AX reference values are omitted from model-visible text.
Accessible item URLs are included as metadata and in freshness guards, so identical
labels at different destinations are distinguishable.

The observer uses the focused window, falling back to the main window, and includes
the focused element separately when an inline editor lives outside that window's
tree. This avoids traversing inactive application menus during inline editing.

### Sheets, dialogs and popovers

When something blocks the observed window, `MacOSHybridBackend` offers only its
controls, and limits OCR to its bounds. AppKit lists only standard windows in
`AXWindows`: a sheet is an `AXSheet` inside its window's tree, and a popover an
`AXPopover` inside the window it is anchored to. So detection uses:

- **The walk.** Elements whose role is `AXSheet`, `AXDialog` or `AXPopover`, whose
  subrole is `AXDialog` or `AXSystemDialog`, or whose `AXModal` is true, are recorded
  as the walk meets them, at no extra cost. When a sheet is open the app usually
  reports the sheet itself as its focused window, so it is the observed root and its
  elements are used directly.
- **App-wide dialogs.** Each `AXWindows` entry's role, subrole and `AXModal` are read
  in one request; help tags (tooltips) listed there never count.

A sheet on another window of the app does not block the observed one and is
ignored. The walk never skips sheets, dialogs, popovers or menus as off-screen,
since popovers and menus can extend past their window. The modal's bounds are its
own accessibility frame. Web dialogs (`AXGroup` with subrole `AXApplicationDialog`)
count only when they report `AXModal`.

Control bounds are decoded from AXValue geometry. `CLICK` invokes `AXPress` when
available or uses the control's current bounds; `AXShowMenu` is not treated as a
left click. Exposed double-click and right-click operations use current geometry.

### Traversal cost

Each attribute read is a request the target app answers on its main thread, so an
observation costs roughly one batched attribute read per visited element. The walk
therefore visits only what is on screen:

- Lists, tables, outlines and browsers contribute their header and `AXVisibleRows`
  (or `AXVisibleChildren`) instead of every row. Columns are skipped; they contain
  the same cells as the rows. Web areas answer `AXVisibleRows` with an empty list,
  so the rule applies to those list roles only.
- Elements whose bounds lie outside the window, or outside an enclosing scroll or
  web area, are skipped with their subtree. Zero-size elements are never skipped,
  because web content can overflow a zero-size wrapper.
- An element without a value is not asked whether its value is settable.

In a Finder list of 2,000 files, an observation reads the 19 visible rows instead of
walking every row, and takes about 50 ms instead of about 30 s.

Electron and other Chromium-based apps build their accessibility tree only for
clients that request it, and discard it again later. Each observation sets
`AXManualAccessibility` on the app; apps that do not support the attribute are not
asked again.

### Cached observation

`MacOSAXBackend(pid, cache=True)` keeps each element read in the previous
observation (`backends/macos_ax_cache.py`). An `AXObserver` on a background run
loop collects the app's notifications. At the next observation:

- value, title, selection, focus and row changes re-read that element;
- created or destroyed elements re-read their parent;
- layout, move, resize and scroll-position changes re-read that element's subtree;
- a scroll bar's value change re-reads the scroll area it belongs to, because
  scrolling is often announced only that way;
- window changes (another window chosen, moved, resized, minimized, menus) and any
  change whose parent cannot be found start over;
- the window element is always re-read, and every container, plus leaf roles that
  host loaded content (groups, cells, rows, scroll and web areas), has its children
  list re-fetched and compared, so elements added without a notification are found.

Unchanged elements cost no requests. In measurements, repeat observations of Finder
and a 75-element app took about 4–6 ms instead of 27–40 ms, with the same result
as an uncached walk. Values that apps change without a notification, such as a
clock in Calendar's week view, can be stale until the element is read again, which
is why the cache is opt-in. Actions are unaffected: `is_fresh` and `execute` read
the target again.

### Settling without screenshots

`MacOSAXBackend.settle_probe()` returns the app's accessibility notification count
(`AXEventMonitor`). It changes within milliseconds of the app reacting and stays
still once the app is idle, so the runtime settles without screen captures or
Screen Recording permission. When notifications are unavailable it returns None and
the runtime compares observations instead.

---

## Local Apple Vision OCR

Some desktop applications expose little useful accessibility information.

For those interfaces, `arc-cua` captures the target window locally and uses Apple Vision OCR to turn visible screen text into indexed elements.

With `ocr="auto"`, the default, `MacOSHybridBackend` decides per observation, after
reading accessibility (and isolating a modal, if any). OCR runs only when no element
is an application control: a role such as Button, CheckBox, RadioButton, PopUpButton,
ComboBox, Link, MenuItem, Slider or a text input, enabled, with an action, labelled
(text inputs need no label), and not a title-bar button. Title-bar buttons are
recognized by their `AXSubrole` (close, minimize, zoom, full screen), recorded as
`metadata["window_control"]`. Spotify, for example, exposes only unlabelled groups
and title-bar buttons, so it gets OCR; Clock, Finder and Calendar do not. Without
OCR no screenshot is captured unless `capture_screenshots=True`, and
`settle_probe()` returns the app's accessibility notification count instead of a
window thumbnail.

```python
DesktopElement(
    id="ocr_91ab...",
    role="visible_text",
    name="Get Lucky",
    bounds=Bounds(...),
    actions=(
        ActionKind.CLICK,
        ActionKind.DOUBLE_CLICK,
    ),
    source="macos_ocr",
)
```

The screenshot is processed locally. JEV receives structured text elements and IDs, not the screenshot itself.
Only screenshot completion checks (below) send an image, and only to a provider that accepts images.

### Visual text-entry targets

OCR does not automatically mean a region is editable.

A region such as `What do you want to play` may be classified as a plausible visual input and expose `CLICK`, `DOUBLE_CLICK`, `RIGHT_CLICK`, `TYPE_TEXT` — while ordinary visible labels remain click-only.

This prevents every OCR string on the screen from becoming an arbitrary typing target.

---

## OCR stability

OCR output is inherently noisy. The same Spotify search field may be recognized across frames as:

```text
What do you want to play
What doyou want to plafP
Q Whatdoyouwantto play
```

`arc-cua` avoids using exact OCR text as visual identity. OCR regions use coarse spatial identity, and overlapping detections are deduplicated before they are exposed to JEV.

OCR text that an actionable accessibility element already represents is also dropped,
so one control is offered under one id, with the stronger AX semantics. The OCR
region's center must lie inside the element's bounds, and its normalized text
(3+ characters) must either appear in the element's name, or cover at least half
of its value. Names match by containment because fast OCR often reads a truncated
label, such as `Norm` for a tab titled `Normal | Applied research`. Values need
the coverage rule because a terminal or document exposes all of its text as one
value; its individual lines stay targetable through OCR. In a Chrome window this
removed 3 of 82 OCR regions, since Chrome exposes most page content as unnamed
groups, and nothing in a terminal.

This keeps small OCR fluctuations from looking like entirely new UI state.

---

## Dynamic JEV action space

The JEV policy builds its choices dynamically from the current desktop state.

A request may contain questions like:

```text
operation:
  CLICK / DOUBLE_CLICK / RIGHT_CLICK / TYPE_TEXT / SET_VALUE / PRESS_KEY / HOTKEY / SCROLL
  SUBTASK_COMPLETE / BLOCKED / NEEDS_AGENT

click_target:
  element_4 / element_7 / element_12

type_text_target:
  element_7

type_text_input:
  effect_name / filename

type_text_then_key:
  NONE / ENTER / TAB

click_modifier:
  NONE / MOD / SHIFT
```

One JEV request can ask for the operation and speculative operation-specific choices in parallel. Only the head corresponding to the selected operation is consumed.

Each target question holds at most `max_candidates` (240) elements. When more are
eligible, focused or selected elements are kept first, then those whose label or
value shares a word of three or more letters with the goal, criteria, constraints
or non-secret inputs, then element order; the kept elements are still presented in
element order, and `state.candidate_truncation` reports how many were dropped per
operation. Each decision's `raw["candidate_counts"]` records the options per question.

These questions are provider-neutral. `ChoicePolicy` (`policies/choice.py`) builds
them and validates the answers; a `ChoiceTransport` sends them. `TypeSafeTransport`
(`policies/typesafe.py`) adds the model name, posts to TypeSafe, and retries rate
limits. An invalid answer raises `Invalid <provider> choice response` and no action
is executed.

The decision's `confidence` is the lowest confidence among the answers it uses,
such as operation, target and input for `TYPE_TEXT`, or operation plus every
verification answer for `SUBTASK_COMPLETE`. Speculative heads that were not
consumed do not affect it. `RuntimeConfig.min_confidence` compares against this
value before any action or completion is accepted.

`Decision.margin` is the smallest lead of the chosen option's probability over the
runner-up's among the same answers. `RuntimeConfig.min_margin` refuses near-ties,
including exact ties, which answer validation otherwise accepts.

### Subtask shortcuts

`subtask_from_dict` and `Subtask` validate the same field types. Verification and
constraints must be lists/tuples of non-empty strings (verification cannot be empty).
They are copied to tuples; strings are never iterated into individual characters.
Input values must be literal strings, finite numbers or booleans, with non-empty
string keys; the input mapping is copied and frozen. The JSON boundary rejects
missing/unknown fields and does not coerce invalid goals or action budgets.

The JEV wire representation puts compact element fields into a shared table:
`state.desktop.element_columns` names the columns and `elements` holds the rows.
Null and omitted trailing columns mean absent fields. Target question criteria
retain the observed IDs and refer to those rows. The subtask is stored once in
`state.subtask`. This preserves compact element facts and the action candidate sets;
it does not prune the desktop to save tokens. Public snapshots and traces still use
their ordinary object representation. A provider token-limit rejection surfaces
as an actionable `max_tokens_exceeded` error without executing an action.

`Subtask.shortcuts` is a mapping from a keyboard chord to its description, such as `{"MOD+S": "Save the current document"}`. The Python and JSON APIs accept the same mapping. It is validated and copied into an immutable mapping when the subtask is created; `compact()` returns a JSON-compatible copy.

For each decision, the policy builds `hotkey_value` from `DEFAULT_HOTKEYS` plus the current subtask's shortcuts. The chord is the choice ID and the description is its criterion. Caller descriptions override descriptions for matching defaults. No choices are stored on the policy or inherited by another subtask.

JEV's selected chord is validated against that request's choices, and `materialize_action` independently checks it against the defaults plus the subtask's declarations. This also applies to custom decision policies: declare any non-default hotkey in the subtask before emitting it. The macOS backend encodes the selected chord using its general key map and modifier flags; it does not implement app-specific task sequences.

---

## Text entry

Literal text always originates from the upstream agent.

The `type_text_input` and `set_value_input` questions offer each supplied input plus
`NONE`: none of the supplied values belongs in this field. Choosing `NONE` ends the
run with `NEEDS_INPUT`; `ExecutionResult.needs_input` holds the chosen field's id,
role, name, current value and, for dropdowns, options. `TYPE_TEXT` is offered even
without inputs, when its only input option is `NONE`, so the model can ask for text
instead of stopping with a generic `NEEDS_AGENT`. `SET_VALUE` is still offered only
for controls that can take one of the supplied values.

For AX text controls, a writable `AXValue` alone is insufficient: the control must
also support focus or editable text selection, or already hold focus. Some item
labels advertise writable values that change only the display, not the underlying
item. Such labels expose navigation/selection actions, not text-entry actions;
the policy must activate a real editor before entering the supplied value.
Committing an edit remains a separate UI action selected by the policy.
Recent action history includes the actual keys, hotkeys, and scroll directions so
the policy can distinguish attempted operations and avoid repeating them.

For OCR-backed inputs, `arc-cua` uses the same macOS text-delivery strategy from Third Hand:

```text
click visual input → select its text → brief settle → post Unicode key-down/up events, 16 characters per burst
```

The text is selected through accessibility (`AXSelectedTextRange`) when the focused
field supports it, otherwise through the app's Select All menu item or a `Cmd+A`
addressed to its window. Modifier flags are explicitly cleared for each Unicode
event so a preceding shortcut cannot leak into the typed text. Key focus returns to
the user's window between bursts.

The decision model chooses `input_key = search_query`. The runtime supplies `Subtask.inputs["search_query"]`. The decision model never invents arbitrary text.

---

## Background input

The macOS backends control one app, given by process ID, without taking the
user's pointer, front app or key window (`backends/macos_background.py`).

- Mouse, scroll and key events are posted to the target process with
  `SLEventPostToPid`, and mouse events carry the target window's id and a
  window-relative location, so WindowServer routes them to that window without
  moving the cursor. A click is preceded by a stamped move and an off-screen
  primer click, which Chromium-based apps require before treating a background
  click as user activation.
- Key events carry an event authentication message, which Chromium-based apps
  require before accepting background keys.
- Before an event batch, focus event records make the target window key inside
  its app while the user's app stays frontmost; afterwards the user's key window
  gets focus back. Without that step the user's app would stay frontmost but stop
  receiving their keystrokes.
- Menu key equivalents only reach the front app, so Command chords are run by
  pressing the matching enabled menu item through accessibility. Other chords are
  keys the window handles itself and are posted to it.
- If the app activates itself within 1.5 s of an input, the user's previous front
  app is activated again.

All private symbols are resolved at runtime; if one is missing, input fails with
`BackgroundInputUnavailable` instead of falling back to the user's pointer.

`MacOSApp.open()` (or entering the backend as a context manager) handles apps
with no window on screen. A minimized window, or all open windows of a hidden app,
are moved onto a virtual display (`CGVirtualDisplay`), then unminimized or
unhidden. WindowServer treats that display as on screen, so the app renders,
exposes accessibility and takes input there, while the user sees nothing. Windows
only move while out of sight, and the backend waits until every parked window's
origin is on the virtual display. `close()` minimizes or hides them again and
moves them back to their original positions; a terminated `arc-cua run` does the
same on `SIGTERM` and `SIGINT`.

Observation uses the app's windows on the current desktop: the AX root is the
focused window when it is on screen, else another on-screen window, because an
app's focused window can be on a different desktop. The settle thumbnail
composites only the app's own windows, so the user's windows on top do not look
like the app reacting.

## Provider request golden files

The request `TypeSafeJevPolicy` sends is the decision model's prompt. For four fixed
observations (a browser form, a Finder list with a declared shortcut, a field with
no inputs, and a case with risky controls, a secret input and history),
`tests/test_golden_requests.py` rebuilds the exact JSON body and compares it with
`tests/golden/jev_request_*.json` character for character, including the order of
questions and candidates. Any change to rules, candidates, the element table or
redaction therefore fails the test and shows up as a diff. After an intended
change, regenerate the files and review the diff:

```bash
ARC_UPDATE_GOLDEN=1 python -m pytest tests/test_golden_requests.py
```

A further test checks that no golden file contains the secret input's value.

## Bounded TypeSafe provider projection

`TypeSafeJevPolicy` uses compact UTF-8 JSON byte accounting (`ensure_ascii=False`,
compact separators and `allow_nan=False`) before sending a request. It applies
conservative 24,000-byte state-plus-longest-question and 48,000-byte complete-body
ceilings; these are engineering margins, not a documented provider tokenizer.
When a full snapshot exceeds them, it keeps candidate closure, focused/selected and
relevant controls, useful ancestors and relevant non-actionable state, then adds
optional context deterministically. Every offered candidate remains present in the
projected state. An unrepresentable essential closure raises
`provider_context_unrepresentable` before HTTP.

A partial projection deliberately cannot establish completion: even a returned
`SUBTASK_COMPLETE` is converted to `NEEDS_AGENT`. The executor still keeps and
uses the original trusted snapshot for freshness, materialization and semantic
guards; packing never rewrites that snapshot.

Task literals contribute through the same word-ranking semantics as other task
text. Numeric `0` and boolean `False` are preserved losslessly whenever their
element is selected by candidate, task, or context closure; they are not alone a
generic relevance signal, since many unrelated desktop readouts share those values.

## Risky controls and secrets

`arc_cua.safety` holds the risk vocabulary and redaction. A control's risk comes
from whole-word matches in its label, per category (`delete`, `send`, `purchase`,
`close`). `ChoicePolicy` leaves such controls out of the `CLICK` and `DOUBLE_CLICK`
target choices unless `Subtask.allowed_risks` includes the category. Before
materializing any action, the runtime checks the chosen target the same way and
ends the run with `NEEDS_AGENT` rather than acting, so custom policies are bound by
the same rule. Keyboard input is not gated; callers declare the shortcuts they allow.

`Subtask.secret_values` are the string forms of the `secret_inputs` values.
`Subtask.compact()` shows those inputs as `[secret]`; `ChoicePolicy` also replaces
every occurrence of a secret value in the observed element table, window and
context, and in `summarize_history`. `result_to_dict`, the CLI's action, result and
error lines, and the runtime's backend-failure log apply the same replacement.

## Freshness protection

Every actionable target has a semantic or visual guard.

Before executing a chosen mutation, the backend checks that the target still corresponds to the UI state JEV observed.

```text
observe → JEV decides → target changes before execution → discard decision → observe again
```

A stale action is never blindly replayed. The runtime also consumes each decision before mutation so a successful action cannot accidentally execute twice during a retry.

## Completion checks

The JEV request includes one verification head per caller-supplied criterion,
alongside the operation and target heads. Each classifies the current evidence as
`SATISFIED`, `NOT_SATISFIED`, or `UNKNOWN`. The policy accepts a proposed
`SUBTASK_COMPLETE` only when every head says `SATISFIED`; otherwise it returns
`NEEDS_AGENT` and a reason listing the unverified criteria. Missing or malformed
verification answers fail validation rather than authorizing completion.

This is a consistency check between model decisions, not proof of application
state. Callers should inspect results and can supply `RuntimeConfig.verify` for an
independent domain-specific check. A policy's optional `Decision.reason` is
preserved in the terminal execution result.

### Screenshots on every decision

`ChoicePolicy(transport, screenshot_steps=True)` sends `snapshot.screenshot()` with
every request and adds `state.image`, a note that the image was captured with the
element table and that its text is untrusted. Targets are still offered ids only.
A snapshot without a screenshot raises before any request. When both options are
set, the completion checks in the same request have already seen the image, so
`screenshot_checks` makes no second request.

### Screenshot completion checks

With `ChoicePolicy(transport, screenshot_checks=True)`, the transport must set
`supports_images = True`. After the first request proposes `SUBTASK_COMPLETE`,
the policy calls `snapshot.screenshot()` and sends a second request with the same
state, only the verification questions, and the PNG in `images`. Their instructions
add that the image was captured with the element table and takes precedence when
they disagree. The second request's answers replace the first request's
verification answers. Its response is kept in `Decision.raw["image_verification"]`,
and its latency is added to the decision's. A snapshot without a screenshot raises,
so completion is never accepted unchecked.

The image is bound to the snapshot: `MacOSHybridBackend.observe()` keeps the window
image that OCR read and sets `DesktopSnapshot.screenshot` to encode it on demand
(scaled to at most 1280 px on the longest side; about 25 ms on Apple Silicon). A
later capture could show a state the model never saw.

## Chrome backend

`ChromeBackend` (`backends/chrome.py`) implements the same `DesktopBackend`
protocol for one Chrome tab. It talks to Chrome over one browser-level DevTools
websocket (`backends/cdp.py`) in flattened session mode. All page-side work is one
script, `backends/chrome_page.js`, evaluated with a method name; it installs its
state on the page's window on first use.

### Observation

One script call walks the document in order, including open shadow roots and
same-origin iframes (with their offsets added to element bounds), and returns:

- **Interactive elements**: native controls, links, elements with an interactive
  ARIA role, focusable non-container elements, `onclick` elements, and the outermost
  element of a custom widget that shows a pointer cursor. Container roles such as
  `listbox` or `menu` are not targets; their items are. Descendants of an interactive
  element are not listed separately.
- **Dialogs**: `<dialog open>`, `role=dialog/alertdialog` and `aria-modal` elements,
  listed first and used as `parent_id` for elements inside them.
- **Text**: headings, live regions, and text blocks whose children are all
  inline, excluding text inside interactive elements and labels of controls.
  Live regions (`role` `status`, `alert` or `log`, or `aria-live` polite or
  assertive) are included even outside the viewport, marked
  `metadata["offscreen"] = true`, because they carry the confirmations and errors
  that completion checks depend on; a screen reader announces them wherever they are.

Only elements that intersect the viewport and pass `checkVisibility` (opacity and
visibility included), outside `aria-hidden` and `inert` subtrees, are listed.
Interactive elements are capped at 250 and text at 120; omitted counts are in
`context["omitted_elements"]`.

Names follow a practical subset of the accessible-name algorithm:
`aria-labelledby`, `aria-label`, associated `<label>`s, `placeholder`/`title`, `alt`,
then visible text or a descendant image's alt text. Checkbox and radio values are
booleans; field values are their text (passwords are masked). A visually hidden
checkbox or radio is located and clicked through its label.

Each DOM node keeps one id (`w<n>`) for as long as it stays in the document, held
in a page-side `WeakMap`. A navigation starts a new page script, so earlier ids no
longer resolve.

### Covered targets

For each interactive element, the script hit-tests its center and four inner
points with `elementFromPoint`, descending through shadow roots and same-origin
frames. If none reaches the element (or its label), it is listed with no actions
and `metadata["covered"] = true`. Before a pointer action, the element is scrolled
into view if needed and hit-tested again; a covered or missing target raises
`StaleDesktopState` and the runtime re-observes.

### Actions

| Action | How it is performed |
|---|---|
| `CLICK`, `DOUBLE_CLICK`, `RIGHT_CLICK` | DevTools mouse events at the reachable point, with `MOD`/`SHIFT` modifier bits |
| `TYPE_TEXT` | Click the field, select its contents, then `Input.insertText` with the literal |
| `SET_VALUE` | For `<select>`, range and date-like inputs: set the value through the native setter and dispatch `input` and `change` |
| `PRESS_KEY`, `HOTKEY` | DevTools key events with DOM key, code and key code; `MOD` is Meta on macOS and Ctrl elsewhere |
| `SCROLL` | A mouse wheel event at the viewport center, 80% of the viewport |

On macOS, Chrome implements editing shortcuts (`MOD+A/C/X/V/Z`, `MOD+SHIFT+Z`) in
the browser process, so those key events carry the editing command explicitly.
A `<select>` value matches an option label (case-insensitive) or value; no match
fails the action.

### Freshness

`is_fresh` re-describes the target with the same script and compares its
`semantic_guard()`, so a changed name, value, state or link URL is stale.
Untargeted actions require the same page URL. `execute` checks the guard again
before acting.

### Settling

`settle_probe()` returns the URL, `document.readyState`, a DOM mutation counter
(inline `style` changes excluded, so JavaScript animations do not look like
activity), the focused element and the scroll position. During a navigation the
probe returns `("unavailable",)`, which the runtime treats as a change and keeps
waiting on.

### Dialogs and new tabs

A JavaScript dialog blocks the page's script, so the backend tracks
`Page.javascriptDialogOpening`. Input commands stop waiting when a dialog opens,
because Chrome withholds their responses until it closes. While a dialog is open,
`observe()` returns it as `dialog_message` with `dialog_accept` and, except for
`alert`, `dialog_dismiss` buttons, answered with `Page.handleJavaScriptDialog`.

When the tab opens another page (for example a `target=_blank` link), the backend
activates and attaches to it at the next observation, and reports
`context["switched_to_new_tab"] = True`.
